## Development Guide

_Contribution guidelines for Desktop app TBA!_

<!-- Before contributing, make yourself familiar with [our contribution guidelines](https://developers.revolt.chat/contrib.html), the [code style guidelines](./GUIDELINES.md), and the [technical documentation for this project](https://revoltchat.github.io/frontend/). -->

Before getting started, you'll want to install:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/install/)
- [mise-en-place](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html)

Then proceed to setup:

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone --recursive https://github.com/stoatchat/for-desktop stoat-for-desktop
cd stoat-for-desktop

# Install tools from mise
mise install

# install all packages
mise install:frozen

# start the application
mise dev
# ... or build the bundle
mise build
# ... or build all distributables
mise make
```

Various useful commands for development testing:

```bash
# connect to the development server
mise exec -- pnpm start -- --force-server http://localhost:5173

# test the flatpak (after `make`)
mise exec -- pnpm install:flatpak
mise exec -- pnpm run:flatpak
# ... also connect to dev server like so:
mise exec -- pnpm run:flatpak --force-server http://localhost:5173

# Nix-specific instructions for testing
pnpm package
pnpm run:nix
# ... as before:
pnpm run:nix --force-server=http://localhost:5173
# a better solution would be telling
# Electron Forge where system Electron is
```

### Pulling in Stoat's assets

If you want to pull in Stoat brand assets after pulling, run the following:

```bash
# update the assets
mise assets
```

Currently, this is required to build, any forks are expected to provide their own assets.
